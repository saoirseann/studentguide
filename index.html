		<h1>Lost Student Guide</h1>
		<h2>Welcome to the Lost Student Guide!</h2>
		<p>There are two universities situated Belfast. Many students are new to the area and might be feeling a little lost. Have no fear, we at the lost student guide are here to help! We have selected a few locations that students might want to know about.</p>
		<p>If there is something that you looking for more information on, or maybe you are feeling a little lost, you can get in touch with us <a href="html/contact.html">here</a> or via our <a>twitter: @lostStudentGuide</a> or visit our <a href="html/help.html">help page</a></p>
