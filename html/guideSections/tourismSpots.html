        <p>The Marble Arch Caves are a series of natural limestone caves located near the town of Florencecourt in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. The caves are called after the nearby Marble Arch, which is a natural limestone arch at the upstream end of Cladagh Glen under the Cladagh River flows. The caves were formed from three rivers draining off the northern slopes of Cuilcagh mountain, which combine underground to form the Cladagh. Visitors are directed through a mesmerising natural underworld of rivers, waterfalls, winding passages and lofty chambers while strikingly beautiful cave formations gleam all around them. At 7.1 miles long, the Marble Arch Caves form the longest known cave system in Northern Ireland.</p>
